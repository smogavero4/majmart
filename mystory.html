            <h2>The Girl Behind the Initials</h2>
            <p>
                <b>M</b>arissa <b>A</b>nn <b>J</b>acqueline <b>M</b>ogavero (Icardi) is a current, full time podiatrist based in Richmond, Virginia with a passion for art. 
                She has been drawing and painting for as long as she can remember. Growing up she took multiple art classes in high school and in undergrad, 
                minored in Fine Arts and New Media at the State University of New York at Fredonia. With a career in medicine, Marissa initially took her interest of 
                human anatomy and applied this to her artwork. However, she loves to experiment with a wide variety of style and media and over the past couple years 
                she recently discovered an interest in skateboard art. She loves how skateboard art is unique and 3D and how these pieces can be a very cool focal point 
                in any space. She has designed and painted several custom, commissioned skateboard decks. She hopes to continue to grow her small business 
                and expand her skills.
